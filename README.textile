h1. fr.obeo.performance

A simple Java library to record performance data when running tests. 

Inspired by Eclipse's @org.eclipse.test.performance@, but this is simpler and produces an EMF model for the results instead of storing them inside a relation DB.

h2. Basic usage:

pre. 
// Create a global PerformanceTestSuite object
PerformanceTestSuite suite = new PerformanceTestSuite("My test suite");
// For each individual test, create a monitor
PerformanceMonitor monitor = suite.createMonitor("Scenario #1");
// Execute the code to test inside monitor.start()/monitor.stop(). 
// You can do multiple iterations, which will be saved as individual data
// points.
for (int i = 0; i < ITERATIONS; i++) {
    monitor.start();
    doSomething();
    monitor.stop();
}
// This marks the end of the scenario
monitor.commit();
// Alternatively, you can use:
monitor.measure(ITERATIONS, new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    doSomething();
  }
};
// Repeat with other monitors if you have more scenarios
// Finally save the result:
suite.save(URI.createFileURI("/tmp/test.performance"));
